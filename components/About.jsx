          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI
            applications, back-end, production and maintenance using MERN Stack
            web development technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new
            technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish
            a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end
            applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, back-end
            application using ExpressJs and NodeJs, Databases like MongoDb,
            MySql, I am a quick learner and can picsk up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
